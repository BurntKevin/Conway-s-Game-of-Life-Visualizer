        Hey! I'm currently looking to start a website business. I am still going to be working on this website for at least a while. Yes, I chose to not use a framework but I am looking to make it better!
        <br>
        <br>
        Development Plans
        <ul>
            <li>Make the website's font look prettier and better in general</li>
            <li>Add more functionality to the board such as variable grid colours</li>
            <li>Publish a blog on how to make Conway's Game of Life with YouTube videos as well</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        But overall, this is my first project. I find it strange that I love this website and I have spent countless hours on it yet when I think about it, it is a pretty 'old' looking website.
        I am still learning about web development and as this website is relatively simple right now, I can improve it a lot. Right now it is just manipulating grid colors.
        A nice project to get my raw HTML, CSS, Javascript up. But I might use some proper technologies now such as Bootstrap 4, Angular, React to make some cool animations on the grids as well.
        But I would like to call this project fully mine. I'd like to try do it mostly myself if possible.
